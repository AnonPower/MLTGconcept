>Lick the lollipop
command = lick
target = lollipop

You lick the lollipop
(doer) lick the lollipop

Twilight Sparkle = doer
command = lick
target = lollipop

NPCBrain:
Twilight Sparkle lick lollipop

To InOutTrans:
Twilight Sparkle licks lollipop //to be revised, AI doesn't target objects

NPCBrain:
doer = Twilight Sparkle
command = hug
target = player

Twilight Sparkle hug player

To InOutTrans:
Twilight Sparkle hugs Sono

>slap twilight sparkle with a stick
command = slap
target = twilight sparkle
object = stick

We wouldn't say: Slap at Twilight Sparkle
or Slap to Twilight Sparkle
or Slap in Twilight Sparkle

But we could say: Slap Twilight Sparkle

Notice the lack of a toLinkingVerb. Sometimes we use linking verbs, sometimes we don't, grammar.

We are also using an object in the command which is stick.

so we will include, with a stick.

Slap Twilight Sparkle with a stick.

And since this is player input we will append "You" to signify the player as the doer.

You slap Twilight Sparkle with(using) a stick //using is equivalent as with

NPCBrain:
doer = Twilight Sparkle
command = poke
target = Pinkie Pie //also known as ponk
object = sword

Twilight Sparkle poke Pinkie Pie with sword

To InOutTrans:
Twilight Sparkle pokes Pinkie Pie with a sword

Note: If the doer is not the player, the verb or command is pluralized for grammatical purposes and other minor grammartical changes are made.

Sometimes it is important to note there are exceptions.

NPCBrain:
doer = Applejack
command = spits
target = Twilight Sparkle
object = apple cider

Applejack spit twilight sparkle on lemonade //I believe this is the output from NPCBrain in this particular case it could just be: spit lemonade on twilight sparkle

To InOutTrans:
Applejack spits lemonade on Twilight Sparkle

It is important to note the different grammatical cases we may have and that we have to handle each one appropriatley using markers and special identifiers for
different commands.
