From heroic triumph, to tyrannical down fall. Or, heroic down fall, to tyrannical triumph! Play a Zebra nomad, a lone wanderer of the lands in Equestria, lost in your path to enlightenment! Be a Pegasus from Cloudsdale with dreams of joining the Wonderbolts! Inherit the throne from Celestia as an alicorn, lead Equestria to greatness, or fumble it into chaos and destruction! Terrorize the countryside as a dragon and build a mighty horde! Monopolize in Manehatten, through conquering the economics, or scandal! (Don't get caught like Bernie!) Live in harmony with Fluttershy at her cottage, or make her life a living hell!

It is all up to you, just don't expect it to go as planned... It won't be that easy!
